[] Using STL. Solving problems using STL is also a great opportunity to learn about the different data structures that are available for use (stack, queue, set, map) and side by side it is recommended to read up on algorithm analysis (Time Complexity and Space Complexity of an algorithm)

## Qt Framework
 
[] **Read Code** - Test out the example applications given in Qt Creator, key concepts like Signal/Slot mechanism must be understood. 
[] **Create your own application** - Create an application  of your own liking, could be a notepad or a pie-chart editor or an asteroid-tracker.  
[] **Open-source** - Try going through KDE applications as almost all of them are written using the Qt Framework. A good starting point would be to having a look at their [bug tracker](https://bugs.kde.org/) and try searching for "junior" bugs or similar.
